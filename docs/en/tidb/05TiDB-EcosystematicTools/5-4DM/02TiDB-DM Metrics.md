## binlog replication

1. remaining time to sync  
    **a. Meaning** :  
    **b. Colculation** : it's calculated by expr below:  

    ```yaml
                        remainingSize =
    remainingSeconds = ---------------------------------------------------------------
                        bytesPerSec  =  (totalBinlogSize - lastBinlogSize) / seconds
    ```

2. replicate lag  
    **a. Meaning** : The latency time it takes to replicate the binlog from master to Syncer (in seconds)  
    **b. Colculation** : In this [func updateReplicationLagMetric](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/syncer/syncer.go#L890), the metric is updated by ticking per 100ms. the `lag` is calculated in an expression of `time.Now().Unix() - s.tsOffset.Load() - headerTS`. which `tsOffset` represents time range between upstream and syncer, DM's timestamp - MySQL's timestamp, and `headerTS` is minior timestamp,which is binlog `EventHeader Timestamp` parsed by [go-mysql-org/go-mysql/replication](https://github.com/go-mysql-org/go-mysql/tree/master/replication), of every DM worker MySQL.  

3. process exits with error  
    **a. Meaning** : The binlog replication unit process encounters an error within the DM-worker and exits  
    **b. Colculation** : 1

4. binlog file gap between master and syncer  

5. binlog file gap between relay and syncer  

6. binlog event QPS  

7. skipped binlog event QPS  

8. read binlog event duration  

9. transform binlog event duration  

10. dispatch binlog event duration  

11. transaction execution latency  

12. binlog event size  
    **a. Meaning** : The size of a single binlog event that the binlog replication unit reads from relay log or upstream master.  
    **b. Colculation** : At [here](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/syncer/syncer.go#L2159), Syncer'll record every binlog event_size in event header from [binlogstream](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/syncer/binlogstream/streamer_controller.go#L131). So, in grafana, DM uses a type of histogram to draw a quantile curve, including 90%, 95%, 99%.

13. DML queue remain length  
    **a. Meaning** : The remain length of DML job queues, which have `causality_input`, `compactor_input`, `dml_worker_input`, `q_number`,number is calculated in `queueID%defaultBucketCount`.  
    **b. Colculation** : **For `causality_input`** : Causality provides a simple mechanism to improve the concurrency of SQLs execution under the premise of ensuring correctness, which groups sqls that maybe contain causal relationships, and syncer executes them linearly, [more details](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/211e6e7d5fa0944d1f5e0ad585cb8549d5604395/dm/docs/RFCS/20211012_async_checkpoint_flush.md#causality-optimization). So, it records the number of causality component is keeping about rows.  **For `dml_worker_input`** : which means how many jobs were sent to DMWorker. **For `compactor_input`** : it'll equal to the function of causality_input if you config [this feature](https://docs.pingcap.com/zh/tidb/v6.6/dm-dml-replication-logic#compactor). **For `q_number`** : all DMLs at [here](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/syncer/dml_worker.go#L100) will be distributed into different queues(default 8) and when they are executed in [DMLWorker's executeJobs](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/syncer/dml_worker.go#L159), it'll be recorded by the queue name.
