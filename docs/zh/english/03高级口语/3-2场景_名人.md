这个话题是关于“名人”的。在这段对话中，我们可以看到他问我关注“语法”和“为什么对名人感兴趣很正常?”在[关于名人的广播演讲-轨道1.16](https://dogwood.xdfsjj.com/pc/audioDetail.html?id=51352&pcrId=12680494&resId=14718879&resSign=c76b28&type=14)。

## 关于语法

对于语法部分，我们可以看到以下几点:

1. 限定性定语从句 :  
    a. 我们可以用that/which来定义、确定或给出关于名词的基本信息。  
    b. 没有这个条款就没有意义了或句子不完整。  
    c. 例如 : `there are shows that/which pay for plastic suergery.`
2. 非限制定定语从句 :  
    a. 非限定从句用于添加关于名词或其前面从句的额外信息。  
    b. 通常使用 `which`.  
    c. 例如 : `Celebrity magazines,which outnumber news magazines are everywhere.`

## 我的问题

1. 不容易区分定义从句和非定义从句，比如:
    a. in fact : `we love to read about people that celebrity's date, clothes they ware and especially their problems, which the media will often invent.`  
    b. i head : `we love to read about people that celebrity's date, clothes they ware and especially their problems which the media will often invent.`  
    c. importance of problem : it's not every important for me, now.  

2. usually being lost when there appear out of a new words, like:  
    a. i suddenly lost when the word of `avidly` came into my mind in `Million of viewers avidly follow reality and telant shows`.
    b. how to overcome : i think i should notice the structure of whole sentence instead of meaning.However, it's hard without enough knlowledges about words and grammars.  
    c. importance of problem : important, i have to overcome it ASAP.
