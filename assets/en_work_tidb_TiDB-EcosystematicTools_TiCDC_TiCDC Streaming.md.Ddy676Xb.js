The &quot;end&quot; refers to a product unit, including distributed clusters. The main types of &quot;data processing&quot; can be divided into &quot;stream processing&quot; and &quot;batch processing.&quot; Their definitions, characteristics, and origins are as follows, borrowed from the <a href="https://flink.apache.org/flink-architecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Flink official website&#39;s explanation of computing engines</a>:</p><ol><li>In terms of definition: <ul><li>Batch processing: Processes a fixed range of datasets using algorithms like MapReduce or Batch to meet functional requirements.</li><li>Stream processing: Processes datasets without a fixed range using algorithms based on Event-Time data structures to meet functional requirements.</li></ul></li><li>In terms of characteristics: <ul><li>&quot;Batch processing,&quot; as the name suggests, reduces unnecessary performance consumption during calls by processing in batches, thereby improving performance, e.g., MapReduce.</li><li>&quot;Stream processing&quot; emerged as a counterpart to batch processing. For continuously generated data streams like log data or transaction data, stream processing optimizes computation methods based on the inherent orderliness of the data (e.g., occurrence time). For instance, in batch processing, if you want to count the number of changes from state A to state B in Log1 and Log2 between 3:00:00 and 4:00:00, the batch method would aggregate and summarize during the corresponding time window. However, if a change in Log1 falls outside the batch time window (e.g., 4:05:00) due to asynchronous threads or network transmission, this event cannot be calculated in the current batch and must wait for the next batch. This issue can lead to correctness problems in &quot;data synchronization&quot; processing, making stream processing particularly suitable for handling <strong>stateful (e.g., time)</strong> unbounded data streams.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In summary, this section aims to illustrate that data synchronization is suitable for <strong>stream event processing</strong> types. During the study of TiCDC code, it was found to be based on stream event processing.</p><h3 id="_1-2-stream-processing-source-and-sink" tabindex="-1">1.2 Stream Processing Source and Sink <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-2-stream-processing-source-and-sink" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.2 Stream Processing Source and Sink&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In the first article of the TiCDC series <a href="https://tidb.net/blog/70588c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TiCDC Series Sharing - 01 - Brief Background</a>, it was mentioned that TiCDC provides an At Least Once synchronization model. At Least Once describes: <strong>&quot;The delivery semantics of a stream processing system when any component node in the synchronization chain fails.&quot;</strong> The complete set of related semantics is as follows:</p><ol><li>At Most Once: Operator events are processed only once, i.e., downstream operators are assumed to have successfully received messages from upstream by default. Data is lost in case of failure.</li><li>At Least Once: Operator events may be processed multiple times, i.e., if downstream operators fail to receive messages, upstream operators will retransmit the data.</li><li>Exactly Once: Operator events are effectively processed only once, i.e., if downstream operators fail to receive messages, they will receive retransmitted data from upstream. However, for the downstream&#39;s downstream operators (e.g., external systems like MySQL), the message is delivered effectively only once.</li></ol><p>In <strong>stream processing (event processing)</strong>, systems like Google Dataflow and Flink achieve Exactly Once through &quot;deduplication&quot; and <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/chandy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">&quot;distributed snapshots&quot;</a>, respectively. Exactly Once offers better performance but has its pros and cons under different algorithms. For details, refer to <a href="https://juejin.cn/post/6844903857558913038#heading-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Flink China Blog - Discussing the &#39;Exactly Once&#39; Feature in Stream Computing</a>. Returning to why TiCDC only provides At Least Once is unknown. It might be due to factors like expectations, delivery, scheduling, and optimization. However, it is believed that this feature will be provided in the future.</p><p>The following diagram abstracts the synchronization model by comparing it to general stream engines (Dataflow or Flink), where the source is the sender and the sink is the receiver. Currently, two parts in TiCDC can be categorized under this abstraction:</p><ol><li>The process of collecting kv change logs in the tikv cdc component and delivering them to TiCDC Capture.</li><li>The process of collecting data in the puller and delivering it to downstream platforms like MySQL, MQ, or others.</li></ol><figure><img src="'+t+'" alt="07TiCDC_DataFlow_Model" tabindex="0"><figcaption>07TiCDC_DataFlow_Model</figcaption></figure><p>Abstracting to Source and Sink allows applying the &quot;delivery semantics of stream processing systems&quot; to this link. If message delivery fails in this link, it indicates the level of semantic support provided. As mentioned earlier, <strong>TiCDC provides At Least Once semantic support</strong>, which means it will retransmit, and the retransmitted duplicate data will be delivered again. However, due to the implementation of <strong>&quot;idempotency,&quot;</strong> data consistency is maintained.</p><ol><li>If the tikv cdc component fails to deliver a message to TiCDC Capture, it will retransmit.</li><li>If TiCDC Capture fails to deliver a message to the Downstream Platform, it will retransmit.</li></ol><p>The abstraction of Source and Sink in TiCDC also verifies that TiCDC has some similar foundational definitions for achieving &quot;Exactly Once,&quot; but it has not been implemented yet.</p><h2 id="_2-product-architecture" tabindex="-1">2.

TiCDC consists of stateless nodes called Capture, which are composed to achieve high availability through PD&#39;s internal etcd. It supports creating multiple synchronization tasks and synchronizing data to multiple different downstreams.<br> Before understanding TiCDC, it&#39;s essential to grasp some conceptual definitions, such as Owner, Processor, ChangeFeed, ReslovedTs, CheckpointTs, etc. Some concepts are sourced from the <a href="https://docs.pingcap.com/zh/tidb/stable/ticdc-glossary#%E5%8F%98%E6%9B%B4%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TiDB official explanation</a>, while others are derived from personal reading and research of relevant documents and source code.

The number of Processors is related to ChangeFeed, i.e., a multi-table synchronization ChangeFeed is scheduled to each Capture. The Owner will build Processors on different Captures based on the (Capture, ChangeFeed, Table count) tuple.<br> Function: Responsible for pulling, sorting, restoring, and distributing change data for the tables assigned to it. The creation of a ChangeFeed triggers the creation of a Processor, which reads the KeyRange and Region distribution of the assigned tables and establishes an EventFeed gRPC stream. During the continuous streaming process, it maintains its Processor ResolvedTs and Processor CheckpointTs and synchronizes data to the downstream based on the Global ResolvedTs.</p><h3 id="_2-3-puller" tabindex="-1">2.3 Puller <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-puller" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.3 Puller&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Definition: The module that pulls Change logs from tikv.<br> Location: DDL Puller is located within the Processor, one for each Processor.<br>         Row change Puller is located within the TablePipline, one for each TablePipline (i.e., Table).<br> Function: Continuously pulls Change Logs from TiKV, writing to Buffer and Sorter.</p><h3 id="_2-4-mounter" tabindex="-1">2.4 Mounter <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-4-mounter" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.4 Mounter&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Definition: The module that translates KV Change Logs to TiCDC Change Events.<br> Location: Internally within Capture, the Mounter is a global thread pool for Capture, but since it is called by each TablePipline, it is considered internal to Tablepipline.<br> Function: Decodes RawKVEntry into RowChangedEvent, i.e., translates RawKV into the data needed by SQL.</p><h3 id="_2-5-sorter" tabindex="-1">2.5 Sorter <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-5-sorter" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.5 Sorter&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Definition: The module that sorts unordered kv change logs.

The initialization, delivery, and recommendation principles of ReslovedTs are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>ResolvedTs generation</strong>: During the initialization phase, it is the event timestamp passed in at the beginning. After incremental scanning, it is obtained from the logs listened to from RaftStore.</li><li><strong>ResolvedTs delivery</strong>: TiKV CDC Component pushes the data of active Regions&#39; Prewrite + Commit (carrying Ts) to the outside and promotes the non-active Regions&#39; advancement through heartbeat (carrying Ts).</li><li><strong>ResolvedTs advancement</strong>: ResolvedTs is divided into Table-level, Processor-level, and Global-level. The resolved ts obtained by Capture from the kv client is advanced by taking the minimum of all regions sorted by table. That is, the event containing the resolved ts event output after sorting within the table is stored as the resolved ts of this table. The processor summarizes the resolved ts of all tables it is responsible for and the resolved ts of the ddl puller, takes the minimum value, and updates it as the resolved ts of the table.

For example, if a transaction spans multiple regions, some keys may be successfully delivered to the capture while others are not, leading to a loss of atomicity for the transaction. CheckpointTs indicates that all keys less than checkpointTs have been sent to the Capture before this time point.</p><h2 id="_4-startup-process" tabindex="-1">4.

Upon receiving the request, TiKV constructs a rocksdb snapshot and retrieves the Range ( checkpoint_ts, uint64::MAX ] - all records greater than checkpoint_ts.<br> The incremental scan targets the data in TiKV RocksDB. As shown in the example, the incremental scan (TS1,TS5] scans LockCF + DefaultCF and constructs the corresponding perwirte records. It scans DefaultCF and WriteCF to build the records without locks greater than @TS1, simultaneously constructing the data for the continuous streaming phase.</p><div class="language-sql vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">sql</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;">@TS1 </span><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">begin</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;">;                                                 </span></span>
