## About grammar

1. You can avoid repeating words by using auxiliary verbs (e.g., be, have, do).  
    a. The auxiliary can be in the same tense as the first verb.  
    b. He's obviously enjoying it - as I am. (= am enjoying it)  
    c. I think it's a great idea, but my family doesn't. (= doesn't think it's a great idea)  
    d. I haven't been aboard. My friends haven't either. (= haven't been aboard)  

2. The auxiliary can also be in a different tense.  
    a. She obviously changed careers - a lot of people do theese days. (= change careers)  
    b. I hope it works out. It did for me. (= worked out)

3. More on auxiliary verbs to avoid repetition.  
    a. **Simple present or past** : I don't often take risks, but my best friend does all the time.  
    b. **Present or past continuous** : I was hoping to graduate last year. One of my friends was, too.  
    c. **Present perfect (or continuous)** : I've been thinking about settling down, but my friends haven't.  
    d. **Past perfect (or continuous)** : I'd never has straight A's till this year, though my friends all had.  
    e. **Modal verbs** : My dad can't understand why I want to travel, but my mom can.  

4. You can use auxiliaries wirh too, witherm so, and neither to show similarity.  
    a. I'm saving for a trip, and my best friend is, too. Or ... and so is my best friend.  
    b. She doesn't enjoy her work, and I don't, either. Or ... and neither do I.  
    c. She can't afford to go away next year, and I can't, either. Or ... and neither can I.  

5. Use (to) do so to avoid repeating a verb + object or complement.  
    a. Learning to play sports has given me confidence and will continue to do so for many years.  
    b. Many people want to buy their own homw but are not in a position to do so.  
    c. A lot of people want to publish novels but are unable to do do.  
    d. Anyone who wishes to take a career break can do so if they plan it carefully.  

6. Delete words or use one / ones.  
    a. You can avoid repeating infinitive verb phrases by using `to` when it's clear what you mean.  (I would like to write like her, but I'll never be able to. I mean, I'd like to write like her --> I mean, I'd like to.)  
    b. Notice the negatives with try and prefer.  (I shouldn't read trashy novels, and I try not to read trashy novels --> I try not to.)  
    c. You can use one or ones to avoid repeating countbale nouns. Don't use them after my, your, his, etc., some, any, or both useless there is an adjective.  (I've read all her books, Her best one is ... or Of the books I read, the ones I like best are nonfiction)
