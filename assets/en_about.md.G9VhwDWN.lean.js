Subsequently, I also opened several online stores and earned some pocket money 😁, which led to my resolute decision to major in IT when I was in college. During my college years, I assisted teachers in using <strong>Python + Scrapy + chrome-driver + phantomjs</strong> to obtain Boss Zhiping, 51 job and other information for analysis, and the direction of school curriculum reform matched the market demand.</p></li><li><p>Upon graduation, I entered the database industry at the recommendation of my teacher. When I first entered the industry, I chose Oracle, which was stable and surrounded by sound ecology, to study. However, I worked as a database administrator (DBA) at that time. Personally, I think I should go deep into the database (code layer) to learn more about it. Just like <strong>&#39;What I cannot create, I do not understand.&#39; -- Richard Phillips Feynman</strong> said, cannot make cannot really understand. Then had the opportunity to come to work <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/PingCAP/60056692?fr=aladdin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PingCAP</a>, learning a new generation of distributed HTAP database.</p></li><li><p>Follow the idea of in-depth kernel learning, and gradually get to know Golang, Rust, NodeJs and other languages in the process. The technology road is very interesting and is an important force to push the world forward.</p></li></ol><hr><h2 id="video-speech" tabindex="-1">Video speech <a class="header-anchor" href="#video-speech" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Video speech&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><a href="https://asktug.com/t/topic/998896#h-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">【2022年】TiDB 社区年度总结 - 版主 - 苏志鹏（jansu-dev）</a></li></ol><hr><h2 id="certificate-honors" tabindex="-1">Certificate honors <a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-honors" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Certificate honors&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p>Oracle OCP <img src="'+o+'" alt="oracle_ocp"></p></li><li><p>TiDB PTCP(chinese version) <img src="'+a+'" alt="tidb_ptcp_chinest"></p></li><li><p>TiDB PTCA(english/global version 6) <img src="'+r+'" alt="tidb_ptca_global"></p></li><li><p>TiDB PTCP(english/global version 6) <img src="'+i+'" alt="tidb_ptcp_global"></p></li><li><p>PostgreSQL PGCA <img src="'+n+'" alt="pg_pgca"></p></li><li><p>PostgreSQL PGCE <img src="'+s+'" alt="pg_pgce"></p></li><li><p>AskTUG MVA: <a href="https://asktug.com/t/topic/273501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">related link</a><img src="'+l+'" alt="asktug_mva"></p></li></ol><hr><p>网站备案号<a href="https://beian.miit.gov.cn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">（ ）</a></p>',15)]))}const v=c(p,[["render",m]]);export{w as __pageData,v as default};
