## 策略

1. Which one restaurant do you usually go? --> I've been going to an Italian restaurant. Actually, I've been there at least 10 times. I remember the first time I went there was last year. I was looking forward to a place to have dinner. I checked reviews online and found it. Let's have it a try/shot. Finally, It turned out to be amazing.

2. As a matter of fact, this pattern uses three tense to response, that's more likely to get high score, though without hard and abundant words.
