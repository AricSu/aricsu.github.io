TIHC is a chat system designed for TiDB troubleshooting:

- `tihc/`: browser extension (sidepanel UI)
- `tihc-serverless/`: Vercel serverless backend (OpenAI / Manus / TiDB-doc GraphRAG)
- `evalite-demo/`: evaluation project (intake convergence + self-confidence calibration)

Core principles:

- Do not persist user conversations/content by default (stateless)
- If persistence is required, prefer TiDB Serverless and store only minimal fields (optionally with TTL)

Start with Quickstart: `/tihc/quickstart`
