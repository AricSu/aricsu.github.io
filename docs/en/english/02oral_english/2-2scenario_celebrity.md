## About grammar

for grammar part, we can see below points:  

1. Defining clauses :    
    a. we can use `that/which` to define, identify ,or give essential information about noun.     
    b. it would be meaningless without the clause.     
    c. for example : `there are shows that/which pay for plastic suergery.`
 
2. Non-defining clauses :    
    a. non-defining clauses are used to adding extra information about the noun or the clause before it.   
    b. what common in use is to use `which`.      
    c. for example : `Celebrity magazines,which outnumber news magazines are everywhere.` 


## About content
for content part,we can see that in the below, here are three questions i should foucus on:   

1. why is it normal to be insterested in celebrities normal?  
    a. firstly, celebrity obssession is normal, we can see celebrity magazines, which outnumber over news magazines are on every newstand. we love to read about people that celebrity's date, clothes they ware and especially their problems which the media will often invent.    
    b. secondly, there's reality TV. Million of viewers avidly follow reality and telant shows, which makes ordinary people into instant celebrities.    

2. why are we so obssessed?

    b. secondly, Psychologists say it's normal to imitate people who are successful in our society.             
    c. thirdly, with TV, celebrity seems could be able to come right into our home and be sort of part of our family.        

## Problem of mine  
1. not easy to distinguish defining and non-defining clauses, like:    
    a. in fact : `we love to read about people that celebrity's date, clothes they ware and especially their problems, which the media will often invent.`      
    b. i head : `we love to read about people that celebrity's date, clothes they ware and especially their problems which the media will often invent.`      
    c. importance of problem : it's not every important for me, now.     

2. usually being lost when there appear out of a new words, like:  
    a. i suddenly lost when the word of `avidly` came into my mind in `Million of viewers avidly follow reality and telant shows`.      
    b. how to overcome : i think i should notice the structure of whole sentence instead of meaning.However, it's hard without enough knlowledges about words and grammars.    
    c. importance of problem : important, i have to overcome it ASAP.
