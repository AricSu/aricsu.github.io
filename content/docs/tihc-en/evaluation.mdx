## What we measure

“Intake convergence” focuses on the structured output produced at the intake stage:

- `taskType`
- `handleability` (HANDLE_NOW / NEED_MORE_INFO / OUT_OF_SCOPE)
- `missingMep` (missing required fields)
- `selfConfidence` (self-rated confidence)

## Gold eval (supervised)

In `evalite-demo/`:

- `npm run eval:intake`（trace/ollama provider）
- `npm run eval:intake:smoke`（example traces）

## User traces (no labels)

In `evalite-demo/`:

- `npm run eval:intake:traces`

Output:

- `reports/intake-traces-report.md`
- `reports/intake-traces-report.json`

## Trace collection

In the `tihc` sidepanel:

- Set `Eval ID`
- Click `Copy Trace`
- Append to `evalite-demo/data/intake_traces.jsonl` (local file, not uploaded)
