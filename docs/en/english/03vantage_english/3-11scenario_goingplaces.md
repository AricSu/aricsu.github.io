## About grammar

1. When you report things people said in the past, the verb tense often shifts back.  
    a. "The plane's just a 16-seater" --> The agent explained the plane was just a 16-seater.  
    b. "The last bus has left." --> She informed me the last bus had left.  
2. These modal verbs change in reported speech:  
    a. "There may be a delay." --> She said there might be a delay.  
3. Time expressions often change, too. But, these modal verbs don't change, like: could, should, would, might, used to  
    a. "The flights are full today and tomorrow." --> He said the flights were full that day and the next day.  
4. Reported questions use the word order of statements. They do not have question marks.  
    a. "Are you married?" --> People often ask me whether/if I'm married.  
    b. "What do you take with you?" --> We asked people what they take/took with them.  
    c. "Why shouldn't I use hotel shampoo" --> She asked me why she shouldn't use hotel shampoo.  
5. You ndo't need to "shift back" the verb tense when you report information about the present or future that is still true or relevant.  
    a. "Do you have any kids?" "I have two." --> A woman asked me if I have kids. I told her I have two.  
    b. "Where are you going on your next trip?" --> He wanted to know where I'm going on my next trip.  
6. Use an infinitive after ask, tell, order, advise to report a request, a suggestion, or an instruction.  
    a. "Can you lend me a flashlight?" --> My sister asked me to lend her a flashlight.  
    b. "Don't use hotel shampoo." --> A friend told/advised me not to use hotel shampoo.
