TiHC is a browser side panel assistant for TiDB troubleshooting. It builds a GraphRAG index from TiDB Docs, so you can ask questions next to the page you’re reading, get streaming answers, and keep recent chats locally (no database by default).

TiKV p99 latency suddenly spiked — which metrics and logs should I check first?
```
