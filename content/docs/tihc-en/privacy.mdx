title: Privacy & Data
description: Privacy policy for TiHC (data-minimization first)
---

## 1. Overview

TiHC (the “Extension”) is a Chrome browser extension for TiDB users. It provides an AI-powered side panel assistant with streaming responses, local chat history, code copy, and Markdown rendering to help users troubleshoot TiDB issues efficiently.

We take privacy seriously. This policy explains what data TiHC processes and how we protect it.

## 2. Data we process

TiHC does **not** collect personally identifiable information (PII).

Depending on usage, the Extension may process:

### 2.1 User input

- Content you type into the chat (questions/messages)
- Used only to generate AI responses

### 2.2 Local chat history

- Up to the most recent 20 messages
- Stored **locally in your browser**
- Not automatically uploaded, synced, or shared

### 2.3 Non-personal technical information

- Minimal technical data required for the Extension to run (e.g., runtime status)
- No cookies, trackers, or fingerprinting

## 3. How we use data

Data is processed only to provide core features, including:

- Generating AI Q&A responses
- Streaming the response output
- Rendering Markdown
- Supporting one-click code copy

We do **not**:

- Sell, rent, or trade user data
- Use data for advertising or behavioral analytics
- Track users across websites

## 4. Storage and retention

- Chat history is stored only on your local device.
- Up to 20 messages are kept; older entries are overwritten.
- You can delete all local data by clearing browser data or uninstalling the Extension.

TiHC itself does **not** perform long-term server-side storage of your data.

## 5. Sharing and third parties

TiHC does not proactively share user data with third parties.

To generate AI responses, user input may be sent to an AI service API for real-time processing:

- Limited to the current request context
- Does not include user identity information
- Not used for model training or profiling by default

## 6. Permissions

TiHC requests only the minimum permissions required for functionality, including:

- `storage`: to save local chat history
- Side panel / active tab access: to display the assistant UI

TiHC does **not**:

- Read browsing history
- Monitor webpage content
- Access account credentials

Unless you take an explicit action, the Extension does not collect page data.

## 7. Security

We take reasonable technical measures to protect data, including:

- Keeping chat history local
- Avoiding third-party tracking/analytics SDKs
- Limiting permissions to the minimum necessary

## 8. Children’s privacy

TiHC is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from children.

## 9. Policy changes

If this policy changes, we will publish updates via the Extension page or related documentation. Updates take effect upon publication.
