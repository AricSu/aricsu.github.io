## Blog content

1. **What**: mainly records of personal knowledge database in **TiDB Series**,**Oracle Series**, **English Learning notes**, and **worth sharing content**.

3. **How**: In the navigation bar **"Docs"**, record the learning process, also welcome everyone to leave your comments and questions in **"community"**.

## Technical origin

1. When I was in junior high school, I read a book called `Jack Ma's Entrepreneurial Revelation` (PS: Although the content in the book has little to do with technology), which made me see the changes that the Internet has brought to China. Subsequently, I also opened several online stores and earned some pocket money 😁, which led to my resolute decision to major in IT when I was in college. During my college years, I assisted teachers in using **Python + Scrapy + chrome-driver + phantomjs** to obtain Boss Zhiping, 51 job and other information for analysis, and the direction of school curriculum reform matched the market demand.

2. Upon graduation, I entered the database industry at the recommendation of my teacher. When I first entered the industry, I chose Oracle, which was stable and surrounded by sound ecology, to study. However, I worked as a database administrator (DBA) at that time. Personally, I think I should go deep into the database (code layer) to learn more about it. Just like **'What I cannot create, I do not understand.' -- Richard Phillips Feynman** said, cannot make cannot really understand. Then had the opportunity to come to work [PingCAP](https://baike.baidu.com/item/PingCAP/60056692?fr=aladdin), learning a new generation of distributed HTAP database.

3. Follow the idea of in-depth kernel learning, and gradually get to know Golang, Rust, NodeJs and other languages in the process. The technology road is very interesting and is an important force to push the world forward.
