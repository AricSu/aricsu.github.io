And DM-worker has a 1 to 1 relationship to the number of MySQL instance, what DM actually does is reading the MySQL binlog and transfering all of them into DML(types of insert, update, delete) and DDL queries at the journey of replication in TiDB Cluster.</p><figure><img src="https://download.pingcap.com/images/docs-cn/dm/dm-architecture-2.0.png" alt="architecture" tabindex="0"><figcaption>architecture</figcaption></figure></li></ol><h2 id="the-purpose" tabindex="-1">The purpose <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-purpose" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The purpose&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p>Based on pages of <code>Master</code>, <code>Worker</code>, <code>Syncer</code> and <code>SourceWorker</code>, I wanna give a brief introduction for DM.
