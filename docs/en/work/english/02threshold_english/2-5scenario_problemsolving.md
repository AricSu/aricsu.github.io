# Scenario of problem solving

## First of all

There are some something below :

1. Talk about things others do for you using get and have.  
2. Describe household problems using need + passive infinitive or need + verb + ing.  
3. Speak informally in "shorter sentences".  
4. Use experssions like Uh-oh and Ouch when things go wrong.

## About grammar

1. When you want to show who you ask, you can use `get + someone + to + verb` or `have + someone + verb`.
    a. I get my brother to fix my car.
    b. I didn't pay to have someone repair my dishwasher.

2. When who you ask is not important, use get or have + something + past particle.  
    a. I get my car fixed at my uncle's garage once a year.

3. You can use need to talk about things that should be done.  
    a. need + passive infinitive. Like : The TV needs to be fixed.
    b. need + verb + ing. Like : The screen needs adjusting.

4. Strategy plus
    a. Ooh! = when you see a problem.  
    b. Uh-oh! = when you suddenly discover a problem.  
    c. Oops!/Whoops! = when you make a small mistake.  
    d. Ow!/Ouch! = "That hurt." / "It sounds like that hurt".
    e. Shoot! = "Oh, no!"(a general reaction)
    f. Ugh!/Yuck! = "It's disgusting."
