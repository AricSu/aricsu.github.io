    **b. Colculation** :

3. **workers' state**  
    **a. Meaning** : workers' state

5. **shard ddl error per minute**  
    **a. Meaning** : number of shard DDL lock/operation error in one minute  
    **b. Colculation** : In `pressimism`,

6. . **number of pending shard ddl**  
    **a. Meaning** : number of pending shard DDL in different states, Un-synced (waiting all upstream), Synced (all upstream finished, waiting all downstream). It has three different types of DDL job, including `None`, `Un-synced`, `Synced`. The metrics will change the one type when every new Lock generates(`None` --> `Un-synced`, like `NewLock` in [pessimism](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/pkg/shardddl/pessimism/lock.go#L45)) or releases(`Un-synced` --> `Synced`).  
    **b. Colculation** : In `pressimism`, when every etcd-input trigged by DM-Workers is captured, if `remian of Lock >0`,which means there are at least one source who hasn't received the DDL from MySQL Binlog, the "OperationPut - LockUnSyncedError" will be added,[details at here](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/master/shardddl/pessimist.go#L525). if the DDL lock has synced ,first it will be marked as done and try to remove the operation for the source, meanwhile, if the delete failed, a "OperationPut - RemoveLockError" will be added, [more detail](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/master/shardddl/pessimist.go#L538).

## binlog replication

1. **remaining time to sync**  
    **a. Meaning** :  
    **b. Colculation** : it's calculated by expr below:

                        remainingSize =
    remainingSeconds = ---------------------------------------------------------------
                        bytesPerSec  =  (totalBinlogSize - lastBinlogSize) / seconds
    ```

2. **replicate lag**  
    **a. Meaning** : The latency time it takes to replicate the binlog from master to Syncer (in seconds)  
    **b.

And It has 90%, 95% and 99% quantile curve.  

10. **dispatch binlog event duration**  

11. **transaction execution latency**  

12. **binlog event size**  
    **a. Meaning** : The size of a single binlog event that the binlog replication unit reads from relay log or upstream master.

13. **DML queue remain length**  
    **a. Meaning** : The remain length of DML job queues, which have `causality_input`, `compactor_input`, `dml_worker_input`, `q_number`,number is calculated in `queueID%defaultBucketCount`.  
    **b. Colculation** : **For `causality_input`** : Causality provides a simple mechanism to improve the concurrency of SQLs execution under the premise of ensuring correctness, which groups sqls that maybe contain causal relationships, and syncer executes them linearly, [more details](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/211e6e7d5fa0944d1f5e0ad585cb8549d5604395/dm/docs/RFCS/20211012_async_checkpoint_flush.md#causality-optimization). So, it records the number of causality component is keeping about rows.  **For `dml_worker_input`** : which means how many jobs were sent to DMWorker. **For `compactor_input`** : it'll equal to the function of causality_input if you config [this feature](https://docs.pingcap.com/zh/tidb/v6.6/dm-dml-replication-logic#compactor). **For `q_number`** : all DMLs at [here](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/syncer/dml_worker.go#L100) will be distributed into different queues(default 8) and when they are executed in [DMLWorker's executeJobs](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/syncer/dml_worker.go#L159), it'll be recorded by the queue name.  

14. **total SQL jobs**

    **b. Colculation** :

    **b. Colculation** :  

20. **unsynced tables**

    **b. Colculation** : Also at [here](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/syncer/ddl.go#L567), It shows that after the `ShardingGroupKeeper's TrySync` function, if it's related to sharding group tables repliation, the metrics'll be update only when you use pessmistic strategy.  

21. **shard lock resolving**  
    **a. Meaning** : Is waiting shard DDL lock to be resolved, >0 means waiting.  
    **b. Colculation** : This metrics is meaningful only when DM uses pessmistic shard strategy to sync a group of tables into one. At [here](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/blob/c65e2b72198de10319008b31dcf13d51509ccfde/dm/syncer/ddl.go#L632), the Guage'll plus one which means the worker is blocking and waitting for DDL lock to be synced. And there'll create another goroutine to watch the `PUT` operation. I mean the stage of resolving is gonna be closed(actually It does the minus operation in the Guage).  

22. **heartbeat update error**
