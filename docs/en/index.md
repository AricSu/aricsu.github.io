## Why did I create blog

1. IT is the fastest industary which can help the world improve ASAP.  
2. I've participated in the area, and I'd better grow up with changes of technology.  
3. I have to find out a way to foribbon forgeting and contribute my own value to the world.

## What does the blog record  

### First of all

1. Mainly, It'll record what I've learned in technic area or accuratelly database area.
2. Also, I've been trying to learn english as a chinese,so that part will be recorded.
3. On the other hand, It's the same recording that some invaluable or worth sharing things.  

### About technic blog

I'll mainly share some interesting things about TiDB. And you can take a look at the navbar of TiDB Notes  

## How can you help me

1. You can look and comments something you wanna tell me in my channel of Bilibili or Youtube, at the upper right corner.  
2. If you are also a githuber,you can submmit an issue in [my blog repo](https://github.com/jansu-dev/TiDB-Learning-Notes).

## Technical origin

1. When I was in junior high school, I read a book called `Jack Ma's Entrepreneurial Revelation` (PS: Although the content in the book has little to do with technology), which made me see the changes that the Internet has brought to China. Subsequently, I also opened several online stores and earned some pocket money üòÅ, which led to my resolute decision to major in IT when I was in college. During my college years, I assisted teachers in using **Python + Scrapy + chrome-driver + phantomjs** to obtain Boss Zhiping, 51 job and other information for analysis, and the direction of school curriculum reform matched the market demand.

2. Upon graduation, I entered the database industry at the recommendation of my teacher. When I first entered the industry, I chose Oracle, which was stable and surrounded by sound ecology, to study. However, I worked as a database administrator (DBA) at that time. Personally, I think I should go deep into the database (code layer) to learn more about it. Just like **'What I cannot create, I do not understand.' -- Richard Phillips Feynman** said, cannot make cannot really understand. Then had the opportunity to come to work [PingCAP](https://baike.baidu.com/item/PingCAP/60056692?fr=aladdin), learning a new generation of distributed HTAP database.

3. Follow the idea of in-depth kernel learning, and gradually get to know Golang, Rust, NodeJs and other languages in the process. The technology road is very interesting and is an important force to push the world forward.

## Open source projects

(Nothing is more convincing to a programmer than Show me the code.)

- [TiHC](https://github.com/jansu-dev/tihc) : TiHC (TiDB Healthy Check) is an open source, RUst-built TiDB inspection tool designed to reduce inquiry times and improve delivery efficiency. Based on the principle of ssh distribution by TiDB official tool tiup, distributed collection of node information and grafana monitoring were integrated to generate a deliverable inspection Office Doc file.

- [MBR](https://github.com/jansu-dev/mbr) : The MBR(MicroBR) is a small toy built by Rust and mimics some functions of the TiDB BR. It implements some interfaces and functions of the TiDB physical backup tool.
