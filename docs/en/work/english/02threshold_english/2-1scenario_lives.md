## About grammar

1. Simple verbs are for `complete actions` or `permanent actions`:
    a. Present : what kind of music do you listen to? I love jazz and blue music. I listen to it a lot.  
    b. Present perfect : Have you ever lived in another country? No, I've never lived anywhere else.
    c. Past : what did you do for your last brithday? I went to home and had a big party.  

2. Countinuous verbs are for `ongoing actions` or `temporary situations`:  
    a. Present : what kind of music are you listening to currently? I'm listening to a lot of Latin right now.
    b. Present perfect : How long have you been living here? I've been living here for five years.  
    c. Past : What were you doing at ths time yesterday? I was sitting on bus.

3. Fixed comparing expressions :
    a. `Verb + verb + ing`
    b. `Verb + particle/preposition + verb + ing`
    c. `Verb + to + verb`
    d. `Verb + ing` or `to verb` with the same meaning
