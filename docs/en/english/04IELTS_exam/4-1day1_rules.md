## Rules

![day1-IELTS](../../../../images/english/04IELTS_exam/day1-IELTS-english.jpeg)

## My Oral Problems

1. You are not willing to actively express yourself
2. You have trouble with fluency
3. Pronunciation is not a problem
4. Not being sensitive to the tenses or accuracy of questions

## Plans

1. Besides the oral part, I also tested the `listening` and felt so bad, because of just finished part of them and right ratio is just 1/14.  
2. So, I need put much more energy in `listening`, `reading` and `writing`. For oral part, the main aim should be keeping the feeling in oral part as usual, and trying to reach the fluent level.  
3. I think my aimed score is 7 at oral part of IELTS.

So, I wanna use 4 months to improve english, and everyday I'll put 2h, at the end day, adding up all of time, it should be 240h.

## Tests

I's my first time to test my oral english score for IELTS, which was powered by `liulishuo.IELTS`. And the result's showed below :

## Puzzled Part

This part isn't relevent to classes or plan I've made in daily life, but, which is the thing I feel puzzled when I was learning.

1. Difference between `think about` and `consider doing`  
In short, "think about" is more general and can refer to any kind of thought process, while "consider doing" usually implies a more focused thought process with the intention of making a decision.
2. Difference between `intention` and `aim`
The difference is that `intention` refers to objective thought process or actions, meanwhile, `aim` is more revelent to their subjective part of though process. For example of `aim`, I can make a sentence which's `I'm warring about if I can achieve my goal in the future`. If the scenario is I'am thinking about something in turly wold, the best choice should be `intention`.
