I recently built a browser extension that works like an AI assistant.

It integrates with a GraphRAG built from TiDB Docs, and you can try asking it some basic questions.

## Download

- Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tihc-browser-extension/jbpafpnafpjejlocihcmilekfemmhpid?hl=zh-CN&utm_source=ext_sidebar

## Browser support

- Microsoft Edge
- Google Chrome

## Status

The extension is still early and has rough edges. If you run into issues or have ideas, please leave feedback on GitHub:
