TiCDC is TiDB’s change data capture (CDC) component. It streams changes from TiKV to downstream systems (MySQL / Kafka / storage / etc.) and is commonly used for:

- **Disaster recovery (DR)** / replica clusters
- **Data integration** (streaming changes into search, analytics, and real-time pipelines)

## 1. Why TiCDC (and not TiDB Binlog)

Historically, TiDB had TiDB Binlog as a replication toolchain. TiCDC was introduced to address major limitations commonly seen in TiDB Binlog deployments, such as:

- Limited scalability (e.g. single-node bottlenecks)
- Throughput constraints in common MQ setups
- Protocol/ecosystem constraints (harder to integrate with standard CDC consumers)
- Operational fragility and limited self-healing behavior

In short: TiCDC is designed as a more scalable, more maintainable CDC pipeline for modern integration/DR use cases.

## 2. Where TiCDC sits in the TiDB ecosystem

You can think of TiCDC as the “egress” layer between TiDB and downstream systems. In practice, downstream targets include:

- MySQL-compatible databases (TiDB / MySQL / RDS-like services)
- Message queues (Kafka, etc.) for stream processing (Flink / Spark / custom consumers)
- Custom sinks via supported protocols (Open Protocol / Canal / Maxwell / Avro, etc., depending on version/support level)

## 3. Typical pipelines

Common production patterns:

- **TiDB → TiCDC → Kafka → Flink → (Warehouse / Serving / TiDB)**
- **TiDB → TiCDC → MySQL** (for a replica / validation / cutover)
- **TiDB → TiCDC → MQ / sink** for search, recommendation, and real-time analytics

## 4. Getting started (recommended path)

This page is a legacy note. For the most accurate and up-to-date configuration, use the official docs:

- TiCDC overview: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/ticdc-overview
- Scaling TiCDC using TiUP: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/scale-tidb-using-tiup#scale-out-ticdc-nodes

If you want a quick sanity check, validate a minimal changefeed to:

- Kafka (validate topic/partitioning and message format)
- MySQL (validate DML/DDL propagation and lag)
