    a. Present : `if + past form; modal + verb`  
    b. e.g. : What would you do if you saw a homeless person on the street?  
    c. Past : `if + past perfect form`

    e. Mixed present and past  
    f. e.g. : If they still lived in their big house, would they have raised any money? Maybe. But they might not be so close now if they had stayed there.  
3. wish and hope  
    a. Use wish + past form to imagine a different situation in the present.  
    b. e.g. Aya wishes we could eradicate poverty. She wishes the gap between rich and poor was smaller.

4. `what if` clauses are the most common of these expressions, which is mostly used in follow-up questions. It's doesn't usually start a conversation.

## Problem of mine  

1. when I'm reading some sentences, I discover suddenly that I couldn't figure out what kind of meaning does it means.  
    a. analyze result : Grammar is only being used when I'm expressing something after thinking in my brain.  
    b. analyze result : However, when I'm reading, grammar isn't a main part of what I'd check.  
    c. analyze result : I'm not familliar with common phrases and combinding expressions in use, like `a lot less cash`.  
2. my accuratcy isn't good  
    a. like `fashion --> fashionable --> fashionably --> fashionmonger`  
    b. solution : in new words of every note, I'm just gonna write synonyms and different word classes.  
3. Not familiar with word group or word family
